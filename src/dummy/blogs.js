    title: "An epilogue to my time working at Twitter",
    subtitle: "",
    text: "Like seemingly everyone on this app I have plenty of opinions about Twitter > X and figure now is a good time to open up a bit about my experience at the company. I tweeted for years into the void for the love of it like many of you, but after selling my startup to Twitter in 2020 I finally got to see it from the inside. Up close it was both amazing and terrible, like so many other companies and things in life. As someone with a maniacal sense of urgency built into me, Twitter often felt siloed and bureaucratic. Dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone’s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly. You couldn’t just be a builder — you also needed to be a politician. I was shocked by how old and bespoke the infrastructure was, but there was little will to think beyond quarterly earnings calls because we were all beholden to the masters of mDAU and revenue growth as a public company. It often felt like things were held together with duct tape and glue, and that many people had just accepted that a small product change could take months or quarters to build. Management had become bloated to accommodate career growth and the company culture felt too soft and entitled for my own taste. Healthy debate and criticism was replaced by a default refrain of “no, that can’t be done” or “another team owns that so don’t touch it”. Teams could spend months building a feature and then some last-minute kerfuffle meant it’d get killed for being too risky. Just talking directly to customers could turn into a turf war and create deadlocks between functions. I recall one such episode where a teammate spent a month trying to get clearance to reach out to some creators. He went through 3 layers of management and 6 different functional teams. In the end 4 executives were involved in the approval. It was insanity, and unfortunately I saw several top performers get burnt out and demoralized after exhausting experiences like that. Most people were good at their jobs but it was nearly impossible to fire poor performers — instead they got shuffled around to other teams because few managers had the will or resources to figure out how to get them out. A high performance culture pulls everyone up, but the opposite weighs everyone down. Twitter often felt like a place that kept squandering its own potential, which was sad and frustrating to see. The person who was best at cutting through the BS and inspiring a vision during my tenure was Kayvon Beykpour, but he wasn’t fully empowered to run the company since he wasn’t the CEO.",

    subtitle: "",
    text: "Elon Musk is making me look stupid. He’s making me look stupid because, since he acquired Twitter last year for a fee in the region of $44bn, I’ve consistently expected him to start behaving rationally. As everyone has predicted the death of the bird-based social network, I’ve kept saying: relax. Things will end up back where they started. Musk will focus on SpaceX and Tesla, and we’ll return to the mid-value Twitter of the 2010s. And, to some extent, I think that’s where we are. Twitter right now is much less functionally different, compared to a year ago, than people would have you think. There have undoubtedly been changes to the way the timeline is constructed — a greater emphasis, for example, on tweets by accounts that you’re not following — but that’s no bad thing. It’s a pretty similar algorithmic tweak to the one that Instagram has made, or the one that TikTok is built on. This new Twitter is less focused on closed circles, more focused on discoverability. I struggle to find a particularly strong critique of this development. More transformative has been the total destruction of Twitter’s revenue stream. Again, I still think this was not necessarily a thoughtless action: most digital media services would rather run on a subscription-based revenue system than an advertising one. The problem has been that the subscription offering — Twitter Blue — isn’t very good, and has done a lot of damage to the core brand’s reputation. Not least, it has totally destabilised the platform’s curated sense of “trust”, an asset that Musk thinks is low value but his advertisers think is high value. And therefore Twitter has tanked with its biggest revenue stream, advertising. I was convinced that the turning point would be his appointment of a CEO for Twitter, which he made, back in May. Linda Yaccarino — a normal person, as far as I can see — joined Twitter from NBCUniversal. Superficially, her appointment seemed to mark the end of the madcap Musk era — except, of course, it didn’t. Because this week, with Twitter threatened (perhaps existentially) by Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram-fuelled replica Threads, has been one of the most tumultuous of Musk’s reign. “And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand,” he wrote on Sunday, “and, gradually, all the birds.” (Why does this tweet remind me of that line from The Secret History where Bunny concludes an essay by writing: “And as we leave Donne and Walton on the shores of metahemeralism, we wave a fond farewell to those famous chums of yore”?) This slightly cryptic tweet was followed by something more definite from Yaccarino. “X,” she wrote, “is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.” And shortly after that, Twitter’s little bird icon was replaced by a dramatic, stark X, and the process of undoing 15 years of brand-building began.",

      "Thank You to America’s Librarians for Protecting Our Freedom to Read",
    subtitle:
      "I wrote a letter thanking librarians across the country for everything they’re doing to protect our freedom to read.",
    text: "To the dedicated and hardworking librarians of America: In any democracy, the free exchange of ideas is an important part of making sure that citizens are informed, engaged and feel like their perspectives matter. It’s so important, in fact, that here in America, the First Amendment of our Constitution states that freedom begins with our capacity to share and access ideas — even, and maybe especially, the ones we disagree with. More often than not, someone decides to write those ideas down in a book. Books have always shaped how I experience the world. Writers like Mark Twain and Toni Morrison, Walt Whitman and James Baldwin taught me something essential about our country’s character. Reading about people whose lives were very different from mine showed me how to step into someone else’s shoes. And the simple act of writing helped me develop my own identity — all of which would prove vital as a citizen, as a community organizer, and as president. Today, some of the books that shaped my life — and the lives of so many others — are being challenged by people who disagree with certain ideas or perspectives. It’s no coincidence that these “banned books” are often written by or feature people of color, indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community — though there have also been unfortunate instances in which books by conservative authors or books containing “triggering” words or scenes have been targets for removal. Either way, the impulse seems to be to silence, rather than engage, rebut, learn from or seek to understand views that don’t fit our own. I believe such an approach is profoundly misguided, and contrary to what has made this country great. As I’ve said before, not only is it important for young people from all walks of life to see themselves represented in the pages of books, but it’s also important for all of us to engage with different ideas and points of view. It’s also important to understand that the world is watching. If America — a nation built on freedom of expression — allows certain voices and ideas to be silenced, why should other countries go out of their way to protect them? Ironically, it is Christian and other religious texts — the sacred texts that some calling for book bannings in this country claim to want to defend — that have often been the first target of censorship and book banning efforts in authoritarian countries. Nobody understands that more than you, our nation’s librarians. In a very real sense, you’re on the front lines — fighting every day to make the widest possible range of viewpoints, opinions, and ideas available to everyone. Your dedication and professional expertise allow us to freely read and consider information and ideas, and decide for ourselves which ones we agree with.",

    title: "The Portfolio that Got Me a Data Scientist Job",
    subtitle: "Spoiler alert: It was surprisingly easy (and free) to make",
    text: "Getting a Data Scientist job is hard. This isnt 2015 anymore: its not enough to know a few pandas functions and put the words “Big Data” on your résumé. Competition for the top jobs is fierce. On a recent trawl through the LinkedIn jobs board, I struggled to find a London-based Data Scientist role with less than 100 applicants. The good news is that this competition is not due to a lack of jobs. Even in 2023, Data Science remains a fast-growing field, and the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics has estimated that the number of Data Scientist jobs will grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031 [1]. The challenge, then, is not that there are no Data Science jobs — there are tons! Rather, its that a huge number of people are trying to break into the industry, making it increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and land that lucrative first role. The solution: Build a data science portfolio In the current job market, I am convinced that one of the best ways to differentiate yourself from the competition is through building a personal portfolio of personal Data Science projects to showcase your skills and experience. This is especially important if you dont have loads of commercial experience working in Data Science roles. To borrow the words of Data Scientist Will Stanton [2]: If you dont have any experience as a data scientist, then you absolutely have to do independent projects. In this article, Ill walk you through the process I followed to create my portfolio of personal projects, and attempt to give you a bit of inspiration for how you can create one for yourself. If the idea of creating a portfolio feels a bit daunting, dont worry: it is surprisingly easy (and free) to get something up and running, and you dont need any knowledge of web development to start. My background (AKA why I created my portfolio) My journey into Data Science only began relatively recently. My first jobs fresh out of school/university were in fields like…",

      "News Investigation Exposes Shocking Truth: Plastic Bags Dropped for Recycling End Up in Landfills",
    subtitle:
      "A recent investigation by a Chicago news channel uncovered some disturbing evidence.",
    text: "In the U.S., national grocery stores and smaller retailers offer customers a recycling bag program. Customers can drop off used plastic bags in large bins usually located at the front of the store. It takes just a bit of extra time to hold on to your plastic bags rather than trash them, keep them stored somewhere, and then remember to drop them off the next time you go shopping. However, for people hoping to reduce plastic waste, it can give you peace of mind to think you are doing something to help the planet. Unfortunately, a recent investigation by ABC News revealed, your effort to recycle plastic bags may be for nothing. What happens to plastic bags that get dropped into recycling bins? An article on ABC7 Chicago News detailed an investigation into exactly where plastic bags end up after getting dropped off in those bins at the front of stores. According to ABC, “The I-Team, ABC News, and ABC stations across the country assembled 46 bundles of recyclable plastic bags. Each contained a tracking device.” What were the results of the investigation? The 46 bags with tracking devices were dropped off at Walmart and Target stores around the country. Four of them were dropped off in the Chicago area. Here are where the four Chicago bags ended up: A bag dropped off at River North Target ended up in a landfill in Wilmington that has no plastic bag recycling program. A bag dropped off at Target on Chicago’s southwest side ended up at a Waste Management facility in Cicero with no plastic bag recycling program. A bag dropped off at Walmart in suburban Elmhurst ended up at a landfill near Atkinson, Illinois with no plastic bag recycling program. A bag dropped off at north suburban Gurnee Walmart was tracked…",

    title: "I Tried to Leave Medium and Then This Happened",
    subtitle:
      "While I was on a long break from Medium, my stats miraculously picked up",
    text: "I’ve written a total of four stories this year on Medium. My last story was written in March, and it was actually a reprint of one I had previously published on NewBreak. It’s not that I purposely left Medium, I just ran out of time to devote to it. Medium is such a fickle platform. There are no guarantees of making money, and I have been spending most of my time writing for websites where the payment is known and worth my time.I still like it here despite the controversy of a new CEO and the latest Medium changes. I try to ignore whatever is going on at the top and just do my thing writing and reading stories from my favorite writers. But my stats were at abysmally low levels and it’s a lot less fun to write when what you’re putting out there gets seen by so few.I was busySo I found myself focusing on other projects, and staying away from Medium.And then…even though I hadn’t written in months, the notifications started pouring in. An article I wrote in February 2023 was getting claps and comments.I Wrote a Story and Published It on Both Medium and NewsBreak: What Were the Results?It came down to 24 views vs. 7,361medium.comIn the past, I always answered comments as soon as they came in. But with my hiatus from Medium, I ignored these comments. They started piling up. I’ve now got 58 comments on there that I haven’t even looked at.Now this article is nowhere near what I would call “viral.” In fact, the number of views it generated here, I would consider a failure on other platforms I write for. It’s all relative, but for me, on Medium, I’d consider it a successful article.Will I start writing on Medium again? Maybe. After all, I’m writing this. So perhaps this is my intro back into the platform. It all depends on how much time I’ve got for it.",
